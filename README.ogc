# SDL port for Nintendo GameCube/Wii

This port uses the libogc library and the devkitPPC toolchain, available from
http://www.devkitpro.org


## Installation instructions

We highly recommend using the devkitPro pre-built packages provided via pacman
(https://devkitpro.org/wiki/devkitPro_pacman) unless intending to contribute
changes to this port.


## Build instructions

If you need to hack on libSDL itself then the best way to start is by cloning
the package repo at https://github.com/devkitPro/pacman-packages. The GameCube
package is found under gamecube/SDL and the wii one, surprisingly, under
wii/SDL. cd to the appropriate directory and run makepkg PKGDEST=. there
(on systems without a native pacman this will be dkp-pacman). This will produce
a .pkg.tar.zst file in the current directory which can then be installed for
testing with (dkp-)pacman -U ./<name>.pkg.tar.zst. Once that's done you can
modify the code under src/SDL-1.2.15/. To build with your changes first source
the appropriate toolchain vars script - either /opt/devkitpro/wiivars.sh or
/opt/devkitpro/cubevars.sh then run make. To install you can run sudo -E make
install.

The easiest way to contribute changes is to fork our SDL repo at
https://github.com/devkitPro/SDL/ then clone that to src/SDL-1.2.15, replacing
the extracted source. This port is on the ogc-sdl-1.2 branch. Create your own
branch from that, commit your changes and make a PR request to the devkitPro
repo.

Happy hacking!
